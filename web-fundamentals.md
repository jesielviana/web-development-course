## Client-Server Architecture

![Client and Server](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/8973/Client-server.jpg)

Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices and web-accessing software available on those devices.
Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.

Web Server

"Web server" can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.

## DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves the names of internet sites with their underlying IP addresses.

Each named site can correspond to more than one IP address. In fact, some sites have hundreds or more IP addresses that correspond with a single domain name. For example, the server your computer reaches for www.google.com is likely completely different from the server that someone in another country would reach by typing the same site name into their browser.

## Browsers

A browser, short for web browser, is the software application (a program) that used to explore websites.

The main function of a browser is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
